Practical 14, Exercise 1

Using practical 9, exercise 4 as the non recursive function for calculating a factorial.
Using practical 13, exercise 6 as the recursive function for calculating a factorial.
Entering numbers 5, 50, 500, 5000

Using the non-recursive function:

Runs fairly quick until 5000 is entered. Then the program slows significantly.
Entering smaller numbers again, the program is noticeably slower.


Using a recursive function:

Runs quickly until 5000. Then an error is incurred:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
Until this point, there is not an obvious difference in speed.
